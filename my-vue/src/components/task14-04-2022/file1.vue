    <h1>question 1</h1>
    <p>The output for diameter() will be 40 if called because radius variable is assigned 20 value 
        so it will be multiplied to 2 and will return the answer.

        Here perimeter is an arrow function and it will return an error because return keyword is missing
        and syntax is not followed
